# New-York-Crime-Data-Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes crime data in New York City across different districts and builds a predictive model to estimate crime rates based on date and time. The analysis provides insights into crime trends, patterns, and correlations with temporal factors.  

## Key Features  
- **Crime Trend Analysis:** Identifying seasonal and hourly crime patterns.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developing a machine learning model to forecast crime rates based on date and time.  

## Dataset  
We used publicly available crime data from NYC Open Data. The dataset includes:  
- Crime type  
- Date & time  
- Location (district-wise)  
- Other relevant attributes  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting time-based features)  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Visualizing crime distribution per district and time  
   - Identifying hotspots and peak crime hours  
3. **Model Building**  
   - Experimenting with different models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
   - Evaluating performance using RMSE and RÂ² metrics  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Collab
